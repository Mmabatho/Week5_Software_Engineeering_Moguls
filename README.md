## AI Development Workflow

### 1. Problem Definition

- **Objective:** Predict the likelihood of patient readmission to improve care and reduce costs.
- **Stakeholders:** Healthcare providers, patients, hospital administrators.
- **Success Metrics:** Model accuracy, recall (to minimize missed readmissions), and interpretability.

### 2. Data Collection & Preparation

- **Sources:** Electronic Health Records (EHRs), demographic data, clinical notes.
- **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering.
- **Bias Considerations:**  
  - Demographic underrepresentation  
  - Socioeconomic and geographic biases  
  - Clinical impact of biased data

### 3. Model Development

- **Approaches:**  
  - Baseline logistic regression for interpretability  
  - Advanced models (e.g., random forests, neural networks) for higher accuracy
- **Trade-offs:**  
  - Interpretability vs. accuracy  
  - Computational resource constraints (lightweight models, edge computing, federated learning, model compression)

### 4. Evaluation

- **Metrics:** precision, recall
- **Validation:** Cross-validation, subgroup analysis to detect bias.
- **Fairness Auditing:** Regular checks for disparate impact across demographic groups.

### 5. Deployment

- **Integration:** Embedding model into clinical decision support systems.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous performance and fairness monitoring post-deployment.
- **Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms for clinicians to provide feedback and flag errors.

### 6. Ethical & Practical Considerations

- **Bias Mitigation:**  
  - Bias auditing  
  - Data augmentation  
  - Algorithmic fairness constraints  
  - Continuous monitoring
- **Interpretability:**  
  - Use of explainable AI techniques  
  - Clinician involvement in model validation
- **Privacy & Security:**  
  - Compliance with HIPAA and data protection regulations  
  - Secure data handling and model deployment

## Critical Analysis

- **Ethics & Bias:**  
  Detailed in [Critical_Analysis_AI_Healthcare.pdf](Critical_Analysis_AI_Healthcare.pdf), including mitigation strategies and real-world examples.
- **Trade-offs:**  
  Discussed in the README and supporting PDFs, with practical recommendations for balancing accuracy, interpretability, and resource constraints.

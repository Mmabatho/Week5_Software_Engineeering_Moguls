## Part3: Critical Thinking

### Ethics & Bias Section:

Detailed explanation of how biased training data affects patient outcomes through demographic underrepresentation, socioeconomic bias, geographic bias, and their clinical impacts
A comprehensive mitigation strategy featuring bias auditing, data augmentation, algorithmic fairness constraints, and continuous monitoring

### Trade-offs Section:

Thorough discussion of the interpretability vs. accuracy trade-off in healthcare, including clinical context considerations and hybrid solutions
Analysis of how computational resource constraints impact model selection, covering lightweight architectures, edge computing, federated learning, and model compression techniques

The piece includes specific methods, expected outcomes, and practical recommendations that demonstrate critical thinking about real-world AI implementation challenges in healthcare. Each section provides concrete examples and quantitative estimates where appropriate to strengthen the analysis.
